Breadboard Adapter for A2200-A GPS Receiver


This is .7" wide breadboard adapter for the Mestro A2200-A GPS Receiver module for eaiser prototyping. Available at http://www.maestro-wireless.com/a-2200-a

There is an on board vertical SMA connector (Amphenol Connex #132134). The trace to the antenna is .8mm wide with .3mm clearance to surrounding ground plane. I don't have an RF design knowledge so I used the width of the edge connector on the GPS module. An equation in the data sheet calls for 2.88mm trace and the clearance was not given. I made this for a user on Reddit so I don't actually have the GPS module and have not verified the dimensions or it's performance.
